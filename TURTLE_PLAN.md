# Turtle Graphics Implementation Plan for Melete

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive turtle graphics system inspired by your FLATCAD architecture, using 4x4 matrix transformations to support both 2D and 3D operations with hierarchical turtle command trees.

## Stage 1: Mathematical Foundation (3-4 hours)
**Deliverable**: Complete matrix math library
- Create `lib/math/` directory structure
- Implement 4x4 matrix operations (identity, multiply, translate, rotate)
- Implement 3D vector utilities (normalize, cross product, dot product)
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all math operations
- **Checkpoint**: All matrix math tested and working

## Stage 2: Turtle State Management (2-3 hours)  
**Deliverable**: Basic turtle state system
- Create `TurtleState` class (position, heading vectors, pen state)
- Implement basic turtle operations: `forward()`, `left()`, `right()`, pen up/down
- Add local transformation matrix generation from turtle commands
- Unit tests for turtle state operations
- **Checkpoint**: Basic turtle movement working

## Stage 3: Matrix Stack System (2-3 hours)
**Deliverable**: Transformation accumulation
- Implement matrix stack for push/pop operations
- Create `TurtleTransform` class for accumulating transformations
- Add parent-child transformation multiplication (key FLATCAD insight)
- Integration tests with turtle state
- **Checkpoint**: Hierarchical transformations working

## Stage 4: Turtle Command Interface (2-3 hours)
**Deliverable**: Command system architecture
- Design turtle command interface and base classes
- Implement core command types (move, turn, pen state)
- Add command execution engine
- Command validation and error handling
- **Checkpoint**: Command system operational

## Stage 5: Turtle Tree Structure (3-4 hours)
**Deliverable**: Tree-based turtle program representation
- Implement `TurtleTree` data structure
- Add parent-child relationship management
- Create tree traversal for geometry generation  
- Path generation from tree traversal
- **Checkpoint**: Tree structure generates correct paths

## Stage 6: 2D Melete Integration (3-4 hours)
**Deliverable**: Working 2D turtle graphics
- Integrate turtle system with existing Melete layers
- Add `turtle()` function to layer drawing operations
- Implement 2D rendering from turtle paths
- Create demo examples
- **Checkpoint**: 2D turtle graphics fully functional in Melete

## Stage 7: 3D Extension (4-5 hours)
**Deliverable**: 3D turtle operations
- Extend turtle state for 3D (pitch, roll, yaw rotations)
- Add 3D-specific turtle commands
- Implement 3D coordinate transformations
- 3D projection for 2D canvas rendering
- **Checkpoint**: Basic 3D turtle graphics working

## Stage 8: Advanced Features (3-4 hours)
**Deliverable**: Enhanced turtle capabilities
- Named point system and navigation commands
- Advanced turtle operations (face point, etc.)
- Performance optimizations and caching
- Extended demo suite
- **Checkpoint**: Feature-complete turtle system

## Total Estimated Time: 22-30 hours

## Key Benefits of This Approach:
- Each stage is independently testable and useful
- Frequent checkpoints prevent "big bang" issues  
- Builds incrementally on proven FLATCAD architecture
- Maintains compatibility with existing Melete features
- Comprehensive test coverage throughout

## Key Design Insights from FLATCAD Analysis:
1. **Hierarchical Matrix Multiplication**: Each turtle operation multiplies parent's global transformation with its local transformation
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Command parsing, matrix operations, and rendering are cleanly separated
3. **Tree Structure**: Turtle commands form a tree representing the program execution path
4. **Dual Representation**: Both tree structure (for editing/debugging) and final geometry (for output)

## Architecture Notes:
- Use 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrices for all operations
- 2D operations use same matrices as 3D with z=0
- Matrix stack enables push/pop for branching turtle paths
- Command objects store transformation parameters, not final matrices
- Tree traversal generates final geometry by accumulating transformations
