Pick an item from the TODO.md list and work it.

1. Read TODO.md. Decide which is the highest impact item that is not yet done.
2. If the work item seems too difficult or if there is some important design flaw, please say so. Otherwise make a plan to implement and present it.
3. If we decide to implement the feature, the last two items in your plan should be:

- Ask the user directly to confirm that they are satisfied that the work is complete.
- If yes, then update TODO.md by checking off the related item. Do not write a summary, simply add an X to the checklist item to mark it done.
