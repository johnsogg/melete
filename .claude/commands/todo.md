Take a look at the TODO.md and look for the feature related to $ARGUMENTS. If the feature seems too difficult or if there is some important design flaw, please say so. Otherwise make a plan to implement and present it.

If we decide to implement the feature, the last two items in your plan should be:

- Ask the user directly to confirm that they are satisfied that the work is complete.
- If yes, then update TODO.md by checking off the related item. Do not write a summary, simply add an X to the checklist item to mark it done.
