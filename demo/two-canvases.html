    <p>This shows that you can have two or more independtent Melete canvases
    (canvii?) in a single html page. This can be useful if you want programmatic
    images, diagrams, animations, apps, whatever.</p>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <p>Here is the second one. It uses a different div id
    (<code>#gonzo</code>)</p>
    <div id="gonzo" width="1" height="1"></div>

    <!-- The convention I'm running with for the moment is to define landing
    spots in the HTML and reference a single JS or TS file to run everything.
    This might change, and there's no reason why we couldn't have a 1:1 ratio,
    or let some JS files run some but not all landing spots.-->
