# TODOs - keep this clean

- Support 3D (2025-07-02)
- [x] Update the debugging panel such that it is minimized by default, and uses a little bug emoji as its trigger (2025-07-02)
- Support simple turtle drawing operations including `move`, `left`, `right` (2025-07-02)
- We need to support matrix operations for turtle operations in 2D and 3D. Each turtle operation will entail one or more matrix operations that are applied together as a stack. It should be sufficient to use a 4x4 matrix to support all 2D and 3D operations. 2D operations can be simply use the same matrix as 3D, assuming z=0. (2025-07-02)
