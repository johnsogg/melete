# TODOs - keep this clean

- Support 3D (2025-07-02)
- [x] Need utilities for measuring text, such as "what is the expected bounding box for rendering string S with font F at location L" (2025-07-04)
- Create interactive binary search tree demo with animated insertions. HTML UI with number input validation, canvas visualization showing BST structure with proper left/right positioning (including placeholder spaces for missing children), smooth animations for insertions, and consistent layer-based y-positioning for educational clarity (2025-07-04)
